## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
- I started with creating the outline of the code. A body, and then a div within the body which contains the qr code and text
- I formatted the main div and gave it padding
- I used flexbox to center the div within the text and learned that I need to target the html selector as well as the body selector and give them a height before I can use the height in a child element
  -- I know there is another method to center a div. You can use margin auto and then position absolute, set top value, and transform: translate() 
- I adjusted the width of the h1 and h2 divs as they're not quite as wide as the QR code
- I created a shadow around the main div - 2 shadows, one offset to the left and one offset to the right, with a little blur
- I selected the h1 and h2 elements directly. h1 inherits color from the div, while h2 has a separate color. I could also have created ids or classes for these
- I got the google font. I set the h1 and h2 elements to the 400 and 700 numbers directly for the boldness

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div id="main">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code" title="qr-code">
    <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
    <h2>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</h2>
  </div>
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: Outfit;
